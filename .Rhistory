### [1] Let’s explore flights from NYC to Seattle. Use the flights dataset to answer the following
# questions.
# a) (2 pt) How many flights were there to and from NYC in 2013?
# New York airports include: JFK, LGA or EWR
# Origin airports in the data include only these, so all flights are from New York. None to.
nrow(flights) #336776
# b) (2 pt) How many flights were there from NYC airports to Seattle (SEA) in 2013?
# Let's count flights with Seattle destination
sea.flights <- flights[dest=='SEA']
nrow(sea.flights) #3923
# c) (2 pt) How many airlines fly from NYC to Seattle? Hint: look at the function unique()
length(unique(sea.flights$carrier)) # 5
# d) (2 pt) What is the average arrival delay for flights from NYC to Seattle?
sea.flights[, .(Avg.ArrivalDelay=mean(arr_delay,na.rm=T)) ] # -1.099
# Perhaps this means on average, flights to Seattle arrived about a minute early.
### 2. Flights are often delayed. Consider the following questions exploring delay patterns.
# a) (4 pt) What is the mean arrival delay time? What is the median arrival delay time?
# Mean arrival delay time: 6.89 minutes
mean(flights$arr_delay, na.rm=T)
# Median arrival delay time: -5 minutes
median(flights$arr_delay, na.rm=T)
# b) (2 pt) What does a negative arrival delay mean?
# I interpret negative arrival delay to mean that the flight arrived early by that much time.
# c) (4 pt) Plot a histogram of arrival delay times. Does the answers you obtained in (a)
# consistent with the shape of the delay time distribution?
# A mean of 6.89 minutes and a median of -5 minutes seems consistent with this histogram
# because is is skewed right, so there are large outliers.
hist(flights$arr_delay)
# d) (4 pt) Is there seasonality in departure delays? Try
# by(flights$dep_delay, flights$month, function(x) mean(x, na.rm=T))
# and describe what patterns you see. Is there a best month to leave New York? A worst?
# Why might this be?
# There is a significant dip in departure delays during Sep, Oct, and Nov (the minimum). But it peaks in July.
# It could be because fewer people board flights during the Fall, but more in the Summer for vacation.
#months <- c('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec')
